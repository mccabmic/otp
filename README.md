In this assignment, you will be creating five small programs that encrypt and decrypt information using a one-time pad-like system. I believe that you will find the topic quite fascinating: one of your challenges will be to pull yourself away from the stories of real-world espionage and tradecraft that have used the techniques you will be implementing.

These programs serve as a capstone to what you have been learning in this course, and will combine the multi-processing code you have been learning with socket-based inter-process communication. Your programs will also accessible from the command line using standard UNIX features like input/output redirection, and job control. Finally, you will write a short compilation script.
